            <h1>A BRIEF HISTORY OF BELLA'S FRESH MEXICAN GRILL</h1>
            <h3>-by Joe Cottam</h3>
            <p>"In 1998 We Opened our first restaurant at Star Valley Ranch, Wyoming. We were invited in on a
                partnership with some family members who had a long history in Mexican Restaurants. We waited tables for
                12 to 16 hours a day, making people’s dining experience memorable and for some reason we really enjoyed
                it. We decided to move a little closer to home and found a vacant building in Brigham City, Utah. With
                Alicia expecting our second child we began to remodel our dream."<br/><br/>

                "Against The Advice of several businessmen in the area we opened our first Utah restaurant on February
                2, 1999, exactly one month after Samantha Isabel was born. Michael was 2 years old so it was hard to
                keep him entertained and out of the way while Alicia and I worked. The customers would hold Samantha and
                fuss over her until they would leave and then they would pass her to other customers. She would sleep in
                her car seat under the servers' table in the back. Those were some great times and I know there are a
                lot of you out there that probably remember them."<br/><br/>

                "Ruben Parra and my little sister Becca, nick-named Bella, started with us in Afton, Wyoming. Becca was
                only 14 at the time. Ruben is still our head cook and kitchen manager, and is now a brother-in-law. With
                the birth of our third child, blonde-haired, blue-eyed Antonio Jose, for some reason we decided it was
                time to open our 3rd restaurant. When I was a boy, my Father, Don Cottam, always talked about owning his
                own business along the freeway where his kids and grandkids could work. In 2002, we found a piece of
                property in Farr West and Dad’s Dream began to become a reality. Like most family businesses it was
                necessary to do most of the work ourselves. So, my brother Tom came down from Wyoming to help lead the
                construction. About that time, Alicia’s sister, Anita, joined us as a kitchen manager. You might
                remember her selling food out of the “mobile unit’ - as she like to call it - while our flagship
                restaurant was being built. Tom and Anita were also married in 2006. Many of you first started
                supporting us at that food trailer in the parking lot. Thank you!!"<br/><br/>

                "In April 2003with a new face and new menu, we opened our Farr West location which instantly became a
                community Favorite. Tom went from construction manager to kitchen manager, Anita moved from the trailer,
                sorry - 'mobile unit' - into managing the kitchen as well. My sister Maree began managing the front of
                the restaurant, the servers, bussers, and hostess staff. Terri and Becca took over the office, as well
                as our extraordinary servers."<br/><br/>

                "Our Family and Business suffered the loss of our daughter, sister, aunt, cousin, friend and girlfriend
                in January of 2005. Becca June (Bella) Cottam finished her mission on this earth as a result of a tragic
                car accident. Since that time we have tried to immortalize her fun loving energetic spirit in the
                business by printing her name on the menu, engraving it in wood and cement and starting a scholarship
                fund in her name. We started looking at even renaming the Restaurants after her but hesitated because of
                costs. But that hesitation became a heartfelt determination!"<br/><br/>

                "Many Years Later, Dad and Mom have 4 kids and 7 grandkids working at the restaurant, while another 2
                kids and half a dozen grandkids have worked here before moving on. Oh, and Dad and Mom are here every
                day as well. At the beginning of 2008 we decided it was time for that name change we had been talking
                about. Although it took a while, we finally incorporated the name 'Bella’s Fresh Mexican Grill' to honor
                Becca. Bella was Becca’s nickname and it appropriately fits her as it means ‘beautiful’ in Spanish. We
                continue to be most grateful for all your support. We enjoy serving our community. Thanks so much for
                being with us for so long. If not for all of you and our wonderful family, we definitely wouldn’t be
                here today. Both of our Parents were always there and still are showing us the way even in their
                'Retirement Years'. Thank you for making us your favorite restaurant and we look forward to seeing much
                more of you in the near future. The dream is alive!"<br/><br/></p>
