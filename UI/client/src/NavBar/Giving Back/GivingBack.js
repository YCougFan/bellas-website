            <p>Giving is part of our family tradition and has been engrained in us since childhood, thanks to our
                parents. Dad would have been much wealthier if he were not constantly thinking of others and giving to
                others - including the eleven children that he and Mom choose to bring into this world. Besides their
                many children, Mom & Dad opened their home to many others that we kids dragged home with us, from old
                missionary companions from South America to the occasional random homeless guy found rummaging through
                the garbage bins outside of the Hostess Bakery where Dad worked after school to afford to feed all of
                us.<br/><br/>


                We accept and embrace the Giving Nature that we were raised with, and we do as much as we can to give
                back to our community. We proudly partner with our friends at Anything For A Friend, Operation
                Underground Railroad and other charitable organizations as well as families and individuals.<br/><br/>


                On this page we will promote upcoming charitable events as well as photos from past events. We encourage
                all of our friends to attend and participate in charitable giving as often as possible!!</p>
